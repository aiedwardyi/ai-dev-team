# AI Dev Team — Execution Roadmap

## Purpose

This repository implements a deterministic, offline-first **AI Dev Team system** inspired by Lovable-style workflows.

The goal is to demonstrate production-grade applied AI engineering:
- explicit agent roles
- schema-based contracts
- deterministic orchestration
- observable execution artifacts
- safe, auditable file writes

This is not a demo generator. It is designed to behave like a real internal AI-assisted development system.

## High-Level Architecture

**Flow**

User idea
→ Product Manager (PRD)
→ Planner (Plan schema: milestones + tasks)
→ Deterministic Orchestrator
→ Engineer agent
→ Safe file writes
→ Observable artifacts

**Key principle:**
Every step emits structured artifacts that can be inspected, validated, and replayed.

---

## Design Principles

- **Determinism first**
  Identical inputs produce identical artifacts.

- **Explicit contracts**
  JSON schemas define all agent boundaries.

- **Offline-first**
  The system operates without network calls when required.

- **Observable state**
  Execution requests, plans, and results are written as files.

- **Failure visibility**
  Errors are surfaced as artifacts, not hidden in logs.

---

## Phased Execution Plan

### Phase 1 — Foundations (Completed)
- Schema-validated PRD generation
- Planner producing milestone/task plans
- Deterministic offline regeneration
- Safe file write allowlists (foundation)
- Frontend rendering PRD + Plan artifacts

### Phase 2 — Interactive Execution (Completed)
- Lovable-style milestone/task UI
- Deterministic execution request emission
- UI → backend artifact handoff
- Append-only execution logs
- Offline fallback behavior

### Phase 3 — Orchestration & Evaluation (In Progress)
- Orchestrator consumes execution request artifacts (Completed)
- Execution result artifacts (Completed; currently stub executor)
- Regression tests for determinism (Completed; includes golden snapshot guard)
- Deterministic task execution (Next)
- Evaluation harness for output quality (Planned)

### Phase 4 — Production Hardening (Planned)
- Strict schema enforcement
- Replayable execution history
- Multi-agent coordination
- SaaS-ready architecture decisions

---

## Non-Goals

- Fully autonomous unsupervised code deployment
- “Magic” generation without traceability
- Hidden state or implicit agent behavior

---

## Quality Bar

A change is considered complete only if:
- artifacts are deterministic
- schemas are validated
- failure modes are visible
- outputs can be reasoned about by inspection

---

## Audience

This repository is intended for:
- Applied AI / LLM engineers
- Platform engineers
- Founders building AI-assisted developer tooling
- Teams evaluating deterministic agent orchestration patterns
